Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.
We must have ids as the primary key of the tables
Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.

Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.
